# Stake Weighted Voting

**Status: Draft**

Each account has a variable voting power determined by the amount of NEAR staked at the block height specified in a proposal. Instead of one account = one vote credit, which is gameable in pseudo anonymous world of blockchains (accounts are easy to forge, a proper solution will require human gating mechanism, which is part of the v2 Framework), each account will cast power vote.

The system is being built collaboratively by Proximity Labs and the GWG.
