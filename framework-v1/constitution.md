# The Constitution of the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC)

The NEAR Constitution is first and foremost a living document, undergoing active polling, edits, feedback, and iterations from the many collaborators inside and beyond the NEAR Digital Collective. We are currently at Year 0 in a decade-long roll-out of on-chain governance in the NEAR Ecosystem. That means there is always a seat at the table for thoughtful input and collaborative feedback.

Our fast-growing community known as the NEAR Digital collective operates as a public square for all stakeholders inside of the NEAR Ecosystem. Governance on NEAR holds the promise of bringing these stakeholders together to align financially, socially, and technologically on where to take the ecosystem in the future. But to do this successfully, we need to all agree on certain key principles and values:

1. **Inclusiveness**: This entire process is meant to improve the ecosystem! This means that the NDC will not infringe on any protocol or dApp building on NEAR, nor will it operate in a biased manner in its selection of members or collective feedback sessions. A transparency commission exists for this very reason (See below!).

1. **Adaptability**: Crypto moves fast, and tends to be volatile. The NDC is here to stay for the long-term. Adaptability is all about being antifragile in the face of adversity, tough market conditions, or challenges that face the protocol. Our mindset is to work through and beyond problems.

1. **Transparency**: As one of the largest on-chain treasuries in all of crypto, we have a responsibility to our community and the future stakeholders of the NEAR Ecosystem to operate fully transparently. This is the expectation of every public servant and participant in governance through the NDC.

1. **Ecosystem First**: Mercenaries are abundant in crypto - especially in bear markets. Working and helping out with the NDC requires all members to put the Ecosystem first. This means that contributors are expected to deliver and build a reputation for themselves amongst their peers in the NDC, before expecting rewards. The NDC is first and foremost a culture and a vision - not a job!

1. **Anti-Cartel**: In line with the above principles - If you have a conflict of interest, declare it BEFORE you participate. This should go without saying but for extra clarity to all members - a successful NDC requires honest and authentic actors working for the ecosystem as a whole.
   Collective Decision Making: As you will read further below, all positions are democratically elected, with major decisions always being in control of the voting body. Voting is fundamental to the NDC and creating a living governance system of active and engaged human beings.

1. **Freedom to Be Yourself**: There is no discrimination or censorship within the NDC. In line with the aforementioned principles, every member has a right to an opinion and a position on the future of the ecosystem. Being respectful in promoting or sharing that opinion is still expected.

1. **Commons for Everyone**: Our ultimate objective is to make the NDC the most lively, engaged, and exciting place to be in crypto. Smack-dab in the center of the NEAR Ecosystem, the NDC ensures that no member (participating or not) will be subjected to attacks, insults, or discrimination of any kind. This is a safe digital environment to work for a positive future for the NEAR Ecosystem.

1. **Reputation Responsive**: Valuing experience, and the contributions of tried-and-tested loyal NEAR natives is encouraged across all NDC institutions and constellations. The importance of learning from the past and charting a better course of action in the future starts by listening to those who have stuck around through thick and thin.

1. **Human Powered**: The NDC is governed by and for the human community of the NEAR Ecosystem. This means bots, AI LLMâ€™s and other non-human intelligences are not eligible to be used in any of the human roles of the governance process.

In light of these principles, our goal is simple and straightforward: To connect community values to decision-making and budget allocation of the NEAR Treasury, through transparency, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. By doing so, we're building a stronger and more resilient NEAR ecosystem that can thrive for decades to come.

Our Constitution outlines the structure of the NDC, including the Governance Body, Voting Body, and Community Treasury. These entities work together to manage resources, guide the strategic direction of NEAR, and ensure that governance is a reflection of our community values.

The Governance Body consists of (1) the House of Merit, (2) the Council of Advisors, and (3) the Transparency Commission. Each institution serves a unique purpose:

1. **House of Merit** (15 Members to start): Composed of members who have demonstrated outstanding contributions to the NEAR Ecosystem, their role is to propose legislation and allocate the budget, acting as the engine that drives initiatives forward.

1. **Council of Advisors** (7 Members to start): A group of elected representatives responsible for vetoing poor decisions from the House of Merit, acting as a brake that ensures the long-term sustainability and growth of the NEAR Ecosystem.

1. **Transparency Commission** (7 Members to start): Tasked with removing or banning malicious members from participation, the Transparency Commission serves as an emergency stop that keeps the governance process transparent, accountable, and free from conflicts of interest.

1. **The Voting Body** (All of us!) consisting of all Humans on NEAR, plays a crucial role in the decision-making process by electing all positions within the Governance Body. Additionally, the Voting Body has the power to veto big budget items, recurring budget items, and dissolve entire houses if they are deemed incompetent.

Amendments to the Constitution can be proposed and passed through the House of Merit, ensuring our governance can adapt and grow with the needs of the ecosystem.

With the NDC we embrace the power of decentralized governance to create a committed, aligned, and passionate community that makes NEAR a household name beyond Crypto.

In the spirit of optimism and collaboration, we invite everyone to join us in building a better future for the NEAR Ecosystem and beyond.
